      <h1>My name is Jacob Sykes</h1>
      <p>I am a game developer, and I always put a lot of thought into stories I make for them, having a strong focus for storytelling and worldbuilding. Making meaningful narriatives is one of my favorite parts of the creative process, so I have many ideas for new games, characters, worlds and plotlines. I am always pushing myself to refine my skills by experimenting with new concepts, to make my ideas a reality, with as much care and detail as possible.</p>
